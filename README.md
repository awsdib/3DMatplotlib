 A three-dimensional visualization is performed on two types of geodata: A DEM model and a GPS track. The visualization is carried out using “Matplotlib” (v 2.0.0) library for 3D plots which is built on top of Python scripting language. The python console (v 2.7.5) was used inside “QGIS” software (v 2.18.12). Other libraries such as “Numpy” was used to better handling data structures, in addition, built in “date” and “datetime” packages were used to perform time parsing and conversions.
